Capstone: Manage Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets with Terraform
Problem Statement
As part of a cloud infrastructure team, you are tasked with automating the deployment and management of a scalable, load-balanced Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) on Microsoft Azure using Terraform. The solution must include autoscaling capabilities based on CPU utilization and provide reusable configurations for network infrastructure and virtual machines. The goal is to ensure high availability and efficient resource utilization while adhering to best practices.

Requirements
Inputs
resource_group_name (type: string) - Name of the resource group.
location (type: string, default: "westus3") - Azure region for deployment.
vmss_name (type: string, default: "vmss-terraform") - Name of the Virtual Machine Scale Set.
instance_count (type: number, default: 3) - Initial number of VM instances in the scale set.
vm_size (type: string, default: "Standard_D2s_v4") - Size of the virtual machines.
admin_username (type: string, default: "azureuser") - Administrator username for the VMs.
admin_ssh_key (type: string) - Path to the SSH public key file for authentication.
Resources
Network Infrastructure:
Virtual Network, Subnet, Network Security Group, and Load Balancer.
Virtual Machine Scale Set:
Configure azurerm_orchestrated_virtual_machine_scale_set with:
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Canonical publisher).
Fault domain count: 1 (for zonal deployments).
Zones: Enable deployment in specific availability zones.
User Data Script: Base64-encoded script to configure VM instances.
Autoscaling:
Define autoscale rules using azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting with:
Scale-out: Add an instance when CPU usage exceeds 90%.
Scale-in: Remove an instance when CPU usage drops below 10%.
Outputs
application_endpoint (type: string) - Displays the endpoint of the load balancer.
current_instance_count (type: number) - Displays the current number of instances in the scale set.
vmss_id (type: string) - The ID of the VMSS resource.
admin_ssh_key_base64 (type: string) - Base64-encoded SSH key (base64encode() function).
Validation & Cleanup
Validate:
Confirm the deployment using az vm list to verify instance creation.
Access the application endpoint in a browser.
Autoscaling:
Test autoscale by adjusting CPU load on the VMs.
Verify scaling actions using az vm list after each scaling event.
Cleanup:
Use terraform destroy to remove all resources and avoid unnecessary costs.
Deliverables
Terraform Configuration:
main.tf: Azure provider setup.
network.tf: Network resources configuration.
compute.tf: VMSS resource definition.
autoscale.tf: Autoscale profile and rules.
outputs.tf: Output variables declaration.
Validation Document:
Screenshots and logs of the Terraform commands and outputs.
Post-Deployment Report:
Summary of resource utilization and autoscaling behavior.
Notes
Ensure proper formatting and modularization in Terraform configuration.
Leverage Terraform best practices for input validation, variable use, and sensitive data handling.
